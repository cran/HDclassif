Description: Discriminant analysis and data clustering methods for high
    dimensional data, based on the assumption that high-dimensional data live in
    different subspaces with low dimensionality proposing a new parametrization of
    the Gaussian mixture model which combines the ideas of dimension reduction and
    constraints on the model.
